# **PHP Benchmark Script**

A simple, lightweight PHP script to measure the performance of your server or hosting environment. It executes various computational tasks and reports the time taken for each.

## **🚀 Overview**

This benchmark performs intensive operations to test:

* **Mathematical Performance:** Square roots, trigonometry, and complex arithmetic.  
* **String Manipulation:** Formatting, reversing, and repeating large strings.  
* **Loops & Logic:** Performance of basic control structures and iterations.  
* **Environment Info:** Identifies the PHP version and Server OS.

## **📥 How to Download**
